## Enter the wild and wondrous land of javascripting.
To control a computer with code can feel like wielding a weird and mighty magic. It can seem intangible and unfamiliar, but it’s important to know that code is real and learnable. 

Magic in popular culture typically belongs to those who are born with the power.

The magic of programming belongs to those who practice.

See what some old wizards (Gerald Jay Sussman and Hal Abelson) had to say about the similarities between programming and sorcery in a book called _[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)_:

> A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric _programming languages_ that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

Let’s be sorcerers. _Open Sourcerers_. Let's write some weird little programs, and, as they say in SICP,  “conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.”

## Keep coding
You're at a computer and your hands are sweaty. You have a text editor open and you're reading dense, arcane instructions.

You're about to write javascript for the first time.

It’s difficult, and it doesn’t make sense at first. This is normal.

You’re going to make mistakes.  There’s a trick for dealing with that problem. A trick that works really well.

The trick is to be OK with making mistakes.

Accept that you’re going to fail really hard at first.

I couldn’t ride a bike until I was embarrassingly old – in middle school. All my friends were riding bikes, and I couldn’t keep up with them unless I was on a bike. That motivated me to learn. To be a competent bike rider I had to ignore the moments when I ran into parked cars and fell over.

I had to really want it.

You will forget commas, or type semi-colons instead pf colons, or type something with a capital letter that’s supposed to be all lowercase.

You will run a program and spend agonizing minutes wondering why it spits errors, then realize you haven’t downloaded the needed dependencies.

You’re going to fuck up.

But that’s OK, because you’re OK with fucking up.

This book is meant to help guide you past common fuck-ups, but the book won’t solve all your problems for you. 

Your mastery of programming relies on how motivated you are to learn, and how diligent you are in solving frustrating errors. 

Keep coding.
