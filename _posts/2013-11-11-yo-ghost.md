This weekend I started work on a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator for the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blogging platform: [generator-ghost](https://github.com/sethvincent/generator-ghost).

Currently it will download Ghost and the default Casper theme. You can also copy the Casper theme over to a new folder with the `theme-copy-casper` subgenerator to get started on a customized theme.

## Install

Make sure you have the `yo` module installed:

```
npm install -g yo
```

Install generator-ghost:

```
npm install -g generator-ghost
```

## Usage

Create a directory for your ghost blog and enter that directory:

```
mkdir ghooooost && cd ghooooost
```

Run the ghost generator using `yo`:

```
yo ghost
```

This downloads Ghost and Casper.

To create a new theme based on Casper, run this subgenerator:

```
yo ghost:theme-copy-casper NAME-OF-NEW-THEME
```

That will copy the Casper theme over to a new folder named NAME-OF-NEW-THEME.

## Additional setup

Now, make sure you have the grunt-cli tool installed:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

And run `grunt init` to compile the SASS, Handlebars, and create the directory for Bourbon:

```
grunt init
```

Now, you can run your ghost blog in development like usual:

```
npm start
```

## Todo
I'd like to revise the generator to run the `grunt init` build step automatically. If anyone is interested in working with me on that I'm definitely open to contributions: [github.com/sethvincent/generator-ghost](https://github.com/sethvincent/generator-ghost).

I'd also like to have a theme generator that starts a new theme that's even more bare-bones than Casper.

## Feedback
Let me know in the repository issue queue if you find any bugs or have ideas for the project: [github.com/sethvincent/generator-ghost/issues](https://github.com/sethvincent/generator-ghost/issues)
