I spent a lot of time over the past few days playing this game called [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which is a clone of a game called [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), which appears to be a clone of the game [Threes](http://asherv.com/threes/).

I liked playing this 2048 game. And it took more time and strategy than I expected, but I beat it.

Now, I'm seeing new versions pop up, and it's a fun learning exercise to explore the source code of these games.

## 2048

The 2048 game that stole my free time!

## 2048 3D

A "3d" game board that allows you to push tiles across three quadrants.

## 2048 4D

This fork breaks the game board into 4 quadrants that you can push tiles between. Very challenging!

## 2048 - Multiplayer

A multiplayer version! Fun for spying other people's strategies.

## 177147
This one is a simple fork that uses powers of 3 rather than powers of 2. It's very satisfying to see such big numbers.

# There's more.

2048 has been forked over 900 times, so there's likely other interesting versions of the game!

Find one that's super interesting?
