I just released the first version of _Theming with Ghost_!

You can buy it now, and for the next 48 hours it'll still be at the discounted rate of $15.

This first release includes the first 4 chapters and the full source code for a theme example that's meant as a landing page and blog for a product.

I expect that I'll make revisions to that theme example in the future, but it's already very useful as a boilerplate that you can use to create new themes.

As new chapters of the book are released there will be two additional themes released to those who purchased the book as well. The next update to _Theming with Ghost_ will come out on March 4.

Here's a changelog for this version:

## v0.1.0 - February 10
- Added preface.md
- Added introduction.md
- Added installation.md
- Added ghost-templates-and-handlebars.md
- Added theme-example-landing-page.md
- Added source files for first version of landing page theme
