I posted the first screencast to [subscribe.learnjs.io](https://subscribe.learnjs.io)!

This first screencast is a very basic introduction to JavaScript data types: strings, numbers, arrays, objects, & booleans, as well as equality operators and an overview of the Chrome JavaScript console.

Here it is: [subscribe.learnjs.io/screencasts/introduction-to-javascript-data-types](https://subscribe.learnjs.io/screencasts/introduction-to-javascript-data-types)

I'm starting very simple with these screencasts, and in future updates I'll cover git, GitHub, npm, node.js, advanced JavaScript topics and various JavaScript libraries.

Have requests for topics that should be covered in upcoming screencasts? Email me at hi@learnjs.io and let me know!

And as a reminder, here's the url to subscribe: [subscribe.learnjs.io/users/sign_up](https://subscribe.learnjs.io/users/sign_up)
